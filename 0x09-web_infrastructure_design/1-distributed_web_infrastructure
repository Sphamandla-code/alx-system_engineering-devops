The HAProxy load balancer is configured with the *Round Robin* distribution algorithm which works using the server behind the load balancer in turns, according to their weights.

The HAProxy load-balancer is enabling an *Active-Passive* setup which distributes workloads across all nodes in order to prevent any single node from getting overloaded

A Primary-Replica setup configures one server to act as the Primary server and the other server to act as a Replica of the Primary server but the Primary server is capable of performing read/write requests whilst the Replica server is only capable of performing read requests and data is synchronized between the Primary and Replica servers by the Primary server executes a write operation.

The Primary node is responsible for all the write operations the site needs whilst the Replica node is capable of processing read operations

***************************************
   Issues With This Infrastructure
***************************************

SPOF - if the Primary server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site.

Data transmitted over the network is not encrypted so varnareble. There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server.

We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
