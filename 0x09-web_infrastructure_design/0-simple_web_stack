   Issues With This Infrastructure
***************************************

SPOF - only one of all the componets are installed this would means if that point stops working them the whole website would fail.

maintenance downtime - during maintenance the whole server would go down and the website would be unreacheable because there are no backup servers that would run while the main server is under maintenance.

scaleable - because the is one server running many programs or the server receiving too many request can slow it down.
